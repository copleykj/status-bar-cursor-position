# status-bar-cursor-position

This light-weight package shows the character count at the cursor's position.

![The cursor is shown at position 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refkotay/status-bar-cursor-position/master/img.png)

The position is zero-based. The display is properly hidden outside of text-buffers.
